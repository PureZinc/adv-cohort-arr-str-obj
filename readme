# Arrays, String, & Objects Practice

Welcome! This repository contains a set of TypeScript problems for you to practice and improve your problem-solving skills with Arrays, Strings, and Objects.

## Instructions

- Please FORK and CLONE this repo.
- Add, commit, and push your work to that fork as you go.
- Please send me the link to your repo/work for review before next class.

- Complete the contained problems in **TypeScript**.
- You **do not** need to solve the problems in orderâ€”choose any problem you like.
- If you have **clarifying questions**, ask!
- Simple examples are provided, but you are encouraged to **create more** to test your solutions.
- If you get stuck, **move on to another problem** and come back later.
- If you are stuck for **more than one day**, bring your questions to a **mentor session**.

## Guidelines

- **Do not** use ChatGPT or any other AI tools to generate solutions or review your code.
- If there is a concept you need to review (e.g., **recursion, closures, data structures**), take the time to **look it up**.
- Use **mentor sessions, MDN documentation, and debugging best practices** to work through each problem effectively.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
